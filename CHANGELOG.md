### PRD-First Planning
Added rules to redirect Claude's built-in planning to HQ's PRD system.

**Problem:** Claude Code triggers session-local plan mode for "complex" tasks. These plans live in `.claude/plans/`, are ephemeral, and compete with HQ's persistent PRD workflow.

**Solution:** Skills now redirect to `/newproject` when complex planning is needed. Plans belong in `prd.json` files that persist across sessions and integrate with `/ralph-loop`.

**Changes:**
- All skills: Redirect `EnterPlanMode` → suggest `/newproject` instead
- All skills: Redirect `TodoWrite` → PRD features track tasks

**Result:** Planning happens in the right place (PRD), not session-local files.
