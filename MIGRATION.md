# Migration Guide

Instructions for updating existing HQ installations to new versions.

---

## Migrating to v3.0.0 (from v2.1.0)

### New Skills
Copy these files to your `.claude/commands/`:
- `humanize.md` - Remove AI writing patterns from drafts
- `pure-ralph.md` - External terminal orchestrator for autonomous PRD execution
- `svg.md` - Generate minimalist abstract white line SVG graphics
- `search-reindex.md` - Reindex and re-embed HQ for qmd search

### Updated Skills
The following skills have significant updates. Review and merge:
- `search.md` - **Breaking:** Complete rewrite to qmd-powered search (BM25, semantic, hybrid). Includes grep fallback if qmd is not installed.
- `handoff.md` - Added step 4: search index update (`qmd update && qmd embed`)
- `run-project.md` - Updated orchestration pattern with inline worker pipeline execution
- `execute-task.md` - Worker names aligned with dev-team IDs (`backend-dev`, `frontend-dev`, `dev-qa-tester`, etc.); added `content` task type

### New Knowledge
Copy these directories to your `knowledge/`:
- `pure-ralph/` - Branch workflow, learnings
- `hq/` - Checkpoint schema
- `projects/` - Project creation guidelines and templates
- `design-styles/ethereal-abstract.md` - Ethereal abstract style guide
- `design-styles/liminal-portal.md` - Liminal portal style guide

### Install qmd (Optional)
[qmd](https://github.com/tobi/qmd) powers the new `/search` command with semantic + full-text search.

```bash
# Install qmd (requires Go)
go install github.com/tobi/qmd@latest

# Index your HQ
cd ~/Documents/HQ
qmd update && qmd embed
```

If qmd is not installed, `/search` falls back to grep-based search.

### Breaking Changes
- `/search` syntax changed from grep-based to qmd queries. Install qmd or use the built-in fallback.

## General Update Process

1. **Backup your HQ** before updating
2. **Diff files** before overwriting - preserve your customizations
3. **Merge knowledge** - don't overwrite, combine with your additions
4. **Test skills** after copying to ensure they work with your setup
