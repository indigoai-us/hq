# Ethereal Abstract Style Guide

Visual style for social media, marketing, and brand imagery.

## Mood
Dreamy, contemplative, premium, atmospheric. Like looking through frosted glass at a beautiful sunset.

## Core Principles
1. **Abstract over literal** - Suggest rather than show
2. **Atmosphere over detail** - Soft focus, depth, mist
3. **Warm light over cool tech** - Golden, amber, soft blue
4. **Organic over digital** - Natural forms, no circuits/grids
5. **Minimal over busy** - Single focal point, negative space

- Warm amber, golden, terracotta
- Soft teal, dusty blue, sage
- Cream, stone, charcoal
- Color gradients (natural, not neon)

### Forms
- Abstract light shapes
- Cloud formations
- Water surfaces

## Example Prompts

### Abstract Light
```
Soft golden light diffusing through morning mist,
abstract atmospheric shapes, warm amber tones,
minimal composition, film grain, ethereal mood
```

### Color Field
```
Abstract color field photography, soft gradient
from warm amber to dusty blue, minimal,
atmospheric, out of focus light bokeh,
contemplative mood, fine art aesthetic
```

### Natural Abstract
```
Close-up of light reflecting on still water,
abstract ripple patterns, golden hour tones,
soft focus, minimal, meditative, 35mm film
```

### Cosmic Abstract
```
Soft nebula-like clouds of color, ethereal
purple and gold tones, abstract atmospheric,
no stars or space objects, pure color and light,
dreamy soft focus
```

### Geometric Light
```
Abstract soft geometric shapes formed by light,
warm amber tones, atmospheric haze, minimal,
like light through a prism, ethereal mood
```

## Anti-Patterns (AVOID)

- Glowing orbs/particles (too AI)
- Neon colors, cyberpunk aesthetic
- Circuit boards, tech patterns, grids
- Busy compositions, many elements
- Stock photo feel, generic
- Hard edges, sharp detail
- Text-heavy images
- Generic AI art aesthetic
- Literal representations
- People's faces (unless silhouette/abstract)

## Color Palette

| Use | Hex | Description |
|-----|-----|-------------|
| Primary Warm | #D4A574 | Golden amber |
| Primary Cool | #7BA3A8 | Dusty teal |

| Highlight | #FFD700 | Golden light |

## Composition Rules

1. **Single focal point** - One main element
2. **Negative space** - At least 40% empty
3. **Rule of thirds** - But can break for center
4. **Horizon lines** - Often useful for grounding
5. **Asymmetry** - More natural than centered
6. **Depth layers** - Foreground blur, background blur

## Application

### Social Posts
- Hero images: Abstract light/color fields
- Feature announcements: Minimal + screenshot
- Thought leadership: Atmospheric landscapes

### Headers/Banners
- Wide format color gradients
- Abstract horizon compositions

### Product
- Dark background + clean screenshot
- Light background for docs/guides
