# Liminal Portal Style Guide

Visual style for social media imagery featuring atmospheric threshold spaces.

## Mood

Contemplative, mysterious, transitional. Like standing at the edge of something unknown, about to step through.

## Core Aesthetic

- **Liminal spaces** - Thresholds, doorways, stairs, passages
- **Architectural minimalism** - Empty spaces, clean geometry
- **Atmospheric light** - Glowing portals, warm light sources
- **Film grain texture** - Heavy, visible grain throughout
- **Color gradients** - Warm center fading to cool edges
- **High contrast** - Deep shadows against luminous highlights

## Color Palette

| Role | Hex | Description |
|------|-----|-------------|
| Light source | #F5D5C8 | Warm peach/coral glow |
| Warm accent | #E8A87C | Soft coral |
| Cool shadow | #3D5A5B | Muted teal |
| Deep shadow | #1A1A1E | Near-black |
| Transition | #5C7A7D | Teal-gray mid-tone |

## Composition Rules

1. **Single light source** - Usually a doorway, window, or portal
2. **Ascending elements** - Stairs, slopes, paths leading toward light
3. **Empty space** - No people (or distant silhouettes only)
4. **Centered light** - Luminous area typically center or golden ratio
5. **Surrounding darkness** - 60%+ of frame in shadow
6. **Architectural framing** - Walls/structures create natural frame
