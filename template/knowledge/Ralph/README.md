## Quick Summary

**Ralph** (also known as the "Ralph Wiggum Loop") is a deceptively simple approach to autonomous AI coding that uses a for loop instead of complex orchestration systems. It works by:

1. Breaking work into small, atomic tasks (via specifications/PRDs)
2. Running an AI coding agent in a loop
3. Using "back pressure" (tests, linting, type checking) to verify each change
4. Committing working code and moving to the next task
5. Repeating until all tasks are complete

The key insight is that **simplicity beats complexity** - a basic for loop outperforms elaborate agent swarms, meshes, and orchestrators.

## Creator

**Geoffrey Huntley** - Australian developer, former React Extensions maintainer, and goat farmer who discovered the Ralph methodology in early 2025 while experimenting with LLMs and the Z80 proof-of-concept.

## Origin of the Name

The name "Ralph Wiggum" comes from The Simpsons character, referencing the comedic simplicity of the approach - "I'm in danger!" but actually it works.
