# Learned Helplessness

## What It Is

Learned helplessness is the condition where a person or animal has learned to behave helplessly even when opportunities to escape or improve their situation actually exist. After experiencing repeated situations where they had no control over negative outcomes, individuals may generalize this helplessness to new situations where control is actually possible.

## Origin

Psychologist Martin Seligman discovered the phenomenon in the 1960s through experiments with dogs. Dogs that had experienced inescapable electric shocks later failed to escape shocks even when escape became possible -- they had learned to be helpless. Seligman later connected this to human depression and other psychological conditions.

The research revealed how experiences of powerlessness can create lasting psychological patterns that persist even when circumstances change.

## Applications

- **Education:** Recognize how repeated academic failures can create learned helplessness that prevents students from trying even when they're capable of success. Create learning environments that emphasize growth and incremental progress.
- **Management:** Avoid creating workplace cultures where employees feel powerless to influence their work environment. Micromanagement and rigid hierarchies can foster learned helplessness that reduces creativity and initiative.
- **Personal Development:** Notice areas where past experiences of powerlessness might be preventing you from recognizing current opportunities for change. Sometimes what feels like realistic assessment is actually learned helplessness.
- **Social Justice:** Understand how systemic oppression can create learned helplessness that persists even when some barriers are removed. Effective interventions often need to address both external obstacles and internalized patterns.
