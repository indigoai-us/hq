# Obliquity

## What It Is

Obliquity is the principle that complex goals are often best achieved indirectly rather than through direct pursuit. Happiness comes more readily to those who focus on meaningful activities than those who chase happiness directly. Profitable companies often emerge from focusing on customer value rather than profit maximization. The most direct path to a goal isn't always the most effective approach.

## Origin

Economist John Kay developed the modern concept of obliquity in his 2010 book of the same name, though the underlying principle appears throughout philosophy and strategy. Kay observed that many of the most successful businesses, individuals, and societies achieved their goals through indirect approaches that seemed inefficient but proved more effective than direct methods.

The principle reflects the complexity of systems where direct optimization often fails because it ignores feedback loops, unintended consequences, and emergent properties.

## Applications

- **Goal Setting:** Focus on processes and activities that tend to produce desired outcomes rather than fixating on the outcomes themselves. If you want to be more creative, engage in creative activities regularly rather than constantly evaluating your creative output.
- **Business Strategy:** Consider whether indirect approaches might be more effective than direct competition or market targeting. Building community, solving adjacent problems, or creating unexpected value often leads to better results.
- **Personal Relationships:** Recognize that the best relationships often develop through shared activities and mutual support rather than direct attempts to build intimacy.
- **Learning and Skill Development:** Sometimes mastery comes more readily through play, exploration, and tangential interests rather than focused practice on specific skills.
