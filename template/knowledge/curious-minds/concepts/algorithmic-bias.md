# Algorithmic Bias

## What It Is

Algorithmic bias occurs when computer systems produce discriminatory results due to biased data, flawed design assumptions, or problematic optimization targets. These automated systems can perpetuate or amplify human prejudices, leading to unfair outcomes in hiring, lending, criminal justice, healthcare, and other crucial areas. The bias often appears objective because it comes from "neutral" computer systems, but it reflects the biases embedded in training data and design choices.

## Origin

As machine learning and artificial intelligence became more prevalent in decision-making, researchers began documenting cases where algorithms produced discriminatory outcomes. High-profile examples emerged in the 2010s, including facial recognition systems that worked poorly on darker skin tones and hiring algorithms that discriminated against women.

Unlike human bias, algorithmic bias could be scaled massively and appear more legitimate because it seemed scientific and objective, creating new forms of discrimination that could be harder to detect and challenge.

## Applications

- **Technology Development:** Build diverse teams and testing processes that can identify potential biases before algorithms are deployed. Consider how different groups might be affected by automated decisions.
- **Data Science:** Recognize that "objective" data often contains historical biases and that optimizing for overall accuracy might still produce unfair results for specific groups.
- **Consumer Awareness:** Understand that automated systems making decisions about you -- credit scores, job applications, insurance rates -- may be influenced by algorithmic bias. Know your rights.
- **Policy and Regulation:** Support transparency requirements and fairness standards for algorithmic systems, especially those used in high-stakes decisions.
