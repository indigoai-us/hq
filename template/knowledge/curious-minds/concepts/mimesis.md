# Mimesis

## What It Is

Mimesis, or mimetic desire, describes how our wants are often imitated from others rather than arising from genuine personal preference. We don't just want objects -- we want them because we see others wanting them. The desire is copied along with its target, creating cycles where people compete for the same things not because those things are inherently valuable, but because someone else desires them first.

## Origin

While the concept appears in ancient philosophy, French anthropologist Rene Girard developed modern mimetic theory in the 20th century. Girard argued that human desire is fundamentally imitative -- we learn what to want by watching others. This creates both cultural learning and dangerous competition, as people inevitably desire the same objects as their models.

Girard observed that mimetic desire leads to rivalry and conflict, since multiple people wanting the same thing creates natural competition. He saw this pattern underlying everything from personal relationships to historical conflicts.

## Applications

- **Consumer Awareness:** Recognize when your desires might be mimetic rather than authentic. Do you want that product because it genuinely serves your needs, or because you've seen others wanting it? Social media amplifies mimetic desire by constantly showing us what others covet.
- **Career Decisions:** Notice whether you're pursuing certain goals because they're genuinely meaningful to you or because you're imitating what others seem to want. The most prestigious careers often attract people through mimetic desire rather than authentic calling.
- **Investment Psychology:** Understand how market bubbles form through mimetic desire -- people want assets not because of their fundamental value but because they see others wanting them. FOMO is often mimetic desire in action.
- **Relationship Dynamics:** Be aware of how mimetic desire can create romantic triangles and workplace conflicts. Sometimes we want things (or people) more intensely when we perceive competition for them, regardless of our original level of interest.
