# Astroturfing

## What It Is

Astroturfing is the practice of creating fake grassroots movements or artificially manufacturing the appearance of public support for a cause, product, or political position. Named after AstroTurf (fake grass), it describes campaigns that look organic and citizen-driven but are actually orchestrated and funded by corporations, governments, or special interests.

## Origin

The term was popularized by Senator Lloyd Bentsen in 1985, though the practice is much older. Early examples include tobacco companies creating fake citizen groups to question smoking health risks, and oil companies funding climate denial organizations that appear to be independent research institutions.

Digital technology has made astroturfing easier and more sophisticated. Bots, sock puppet accounts, and coordinated inauthentic behavior can quickly create the illusion of widespread public opinion on social media platforms.

## Applications

- **Media Literacy:** Be skeptical of movements that seem to emerge suddenly with professional organization and messaging. Look for funding sources, check if spokespeople have corporate ties, and notice when supposedly grassroots campaigns use similar language across different locations.
- **Social Media:** Be aware that trending topics, viral content, and comment sections can be artificially manipulated. Real public opinion is usually messier, more diverse, and less coordinated than astroturfed campaigns.
- **Business Ethics:** If you're involved in marketing or public relations, distinguish between legitimate community building and deceptive astroturfing. Authentic engagement with real customers and stakeholders builds trust; fake grassroots campaigns risk serious backlash when exposed.
- **Democratic Participation:** Support genuine grassroots organizing while being vigilant about astroturfed alternatives. Real citizen movements usually have visible leaders, transparent funding, and authentic diversity of voices rather than coordinated messaging and mysterious backing.
