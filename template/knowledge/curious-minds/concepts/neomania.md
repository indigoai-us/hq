# Neomania

## What It Is

Neomania is the obsession with novelty for its own sake -- the compulsive need for new things, ideas, or experiences regardless of their actual value or utility. It's preferring the latest gadget over a perfectly functional older model, chasing trending topics instead of timeless wisdom, or constantly seeking new experiences without fully digesting previous ones. Neomania mistakes novelty for progress and change for improvement.

## Origin

The term combines "neo" (new) and "mania" (obsession), though the concept appears throughout history whenever rapid change creates cultural anxiety about keeping up. Philosopher Nassim Taleb popularized the modern usage, arguing that neomania creates preference for untested innovations over time-proven solutions.

Neomania often emerges during periods of rapid technological or social change when the pace of innovation creates pressure to constantly adopt new approaches.

## Applications

- **Technology Adoption:** Resist the pressure to constantly upgrade to the newest technology without clear benefits. Consider whether new features actually improve your life or just satisfy the psychological itch for novelty.
- **Business Strategy:** Balance innovation with proven practices. While companies need to evolve, neomania can lead to constant reorganization and strategy changes that prevent building on what already works well.
- **Personal Development:** Notice when you're seeking new self-improvement approaches without fully implementing previous learning. Sometimes depth with existing practices produces better results than constantly sampling new techniques.
- **Information Consumption:** Be aware of preferring new information over deeper understanding of timeless principles. The latest trends aren't necessarily more valuable than established knowledge.
