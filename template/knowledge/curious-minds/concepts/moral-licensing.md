# Moral Licensing

## What It Is

Moral licensing is the psychological phenomenon where past good behavior gives you unconscious permission to act less ethically in the future. Donate to charity on Monday, and you might feel justified being ruder to service workers on Tuesday. Support diversity in principle, and you might unconsciously discriminate more in practice. It's as if good deeds create moral credits that you can spend on questionable behavior later.

## Origin

Social psychologists began studying moral licensing in the early 2000s, though the underlying pattern had been observed informally for much longer. Researchers found that people who first had opportunities to demonstrate their moral credentials -- even in small ways -- subsequently felt freer to act in ways that contradicted those values.

The effect occurs because establishing moral identity satisfies our psychological need to see ourselves as good people, reducing the motivation to maintain that standard consistently. Having proven our virtue, we feel licensed to relax our vigilance.

## Applications

- **Personal Ethics:** Be aware of your own moral licensing patterns. Notice when past good behavior makes you feel entitled to ethical shortcuts. Sustainable virtue requires consistent practice, not intermittent bursts followed by relaxation.
- **Organizational Culture:** Recognize that diversity statements, ethics training, or corporate social responsibility initiatives might actually enable discrimination or unethical behavior if they create a sense of moral license. Good intentions must be backed by ongoing accountability.
- **Social Justice:** Understand that symbolic gestures -- voting for a minority candidate, attending a protest, sharing activist content -- can unconsciously reduce motivation for sustained anti-bias work. Moral progress requires persistent effort, not just occasional demonstrations of virtue.
- **Parenting:** Teach children that being good isn't about earning credits to spend later, but about developing consistent character. Help them understand that past kindness doesn't justify current cruelty, and that moral behavior is its own reward rather than a transaction.
