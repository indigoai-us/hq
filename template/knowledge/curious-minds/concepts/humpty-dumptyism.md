# Humpty Dumptyism

## What It Is

Humpty Dumptyism is the practice of using words to mean whatever you want them to mean, regardless of their conventional definitions. Like Humpty Dumpty in "Through the Looking Glass," who insisted that words mean exactly what he chose them to mean, this involves reshaping language to serve your purposes rather than using shared definitions that enable clear communication.

## Origin

The term comes from Lewis Carroll's 1871 novel "Through the Looking Glass," where Humpty Dumpty tells Alice, "When I use a word, it means just what I choose it to mean -- neither more nor less." Carroll was satirizing the arbitrary nature of language and meaning, but the character's approach has become a recognizable pattern in real-world discourse.

The phenomenon reflects how language can be weaponized or manipulated to avoid accountability, win arguments, or reshape reality. When people redefine words to suit their immediate needs, meaningful dialogue becomes nearly impossible.

## Applications

- **Political Discourse:** Recognize when politicians or pundits redefine terms like "freedom," "democracy," or "fairness" to support their positions. When words lose stable meanings, it becomes harder to have productive debates.
- **Workplace Communication:** Be alert to colleagues or managers who consistently redefine terms when challenged. If "collaboration" suddenly means "do what I say" or "innovation" means "cut costs," you're witnessing Humpty Dumptyism.
- **Personal Relationships:** Notice when someone changes the meaning of words like "love," "commitment," or "honesty" to avoid accountability for their actions.
- **Academic and Professional Writing:** Maintain precise definitions and avoid the temptation to reshape terminology to fit your conclusions. Good thinking requires consistent use of terms, even when that consistency challenges your preferred narrative.
