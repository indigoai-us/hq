# Ludonarrative Dissonance

## What It Is

Ludonarrative dissonance occurs when a video game's interactive gameplay contradicts or undermines its narrative story. It's the jarring disconnect you feel when a character who's portrayed as a peaceful humanitarian in cutscenes spends the actual gameplay brutally killing hundreds of enemies. The ludic (play) elements and narrative elements work against each other instead of reinforcing a coherent experience.

## Origin

Game designer Clint Hocking coined the term in 2007 while critiquing the game "BioShock." He noticed how the game's story promoted player choice and free will while the gameplay mechanics actually forced players down predetermined paths.

The dissonance reveals the unique challenge of video games as a medium: they must balance player agency with narrative coherence. Unlike films or books, games give players control over actions that might contradict the intended character or story.

## Applications

- **Product Design:** Recognize when your product's functionality conflicts with its stated purpose or brand message. If you claim to value user privacy but your app collects excessive data, you're creating a form of ludonarrative dissonance.
- **Leadership:** Notice when your actions as a leader contradict your stated values or organizational messaging. Saying you value work-life balance while constantly sending emails after hours creates dissonance that damages credibility.
- **Personal Authenticity:** Be aware of disconnects between your stated values and actual behavior. We all experience some degree of ludonarrative dissonance when our actions don't align with our self-image.
- **Education:** Consider whether teaching methods align with educational goals. If you want students to think critically but only reward memorization and compliance, you're creating dissonance that undermines learning objectives.
