# Sonder

## What It Is

Sonder is the profound realization that every random passerby is living a life as vivid and complex as your own -- with their own ambitions, friends, routines, worries, and inherited craziness. Each person you glimpse from a train window or brush past in a crowded street is the main character of their own epic story, with thousands of stories branching out from their existence.

## Origin

The word was coined by John Koenig for his project "The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows," which creates words for emotions that don't yet exist in the English language. Though recently invented, sonder describes a universal human experience that becomes more poignant in our increasingly connected yet isolated world.

The concept relates to the philosophical notion of "other minds" -- the recognition that consciousness exists beyond our own subjective experience. It's both humbling and awe-inspiring to truly grasp.

## Applications

- **Leadership:** Cultivate sonder to become a more empathetic manager. Remember that each team member has complex motivations, fears, and aspirations beyond their work persona. This deeper awareness can transform how you communicate and motivate.
- **Customer Service:** When dealing with difficult customers, invoke sonder. That angry person on the phone might be having the worst day of their year, dealing with illness, loss, or overwhelming stress.
- **Urban Living:** Use sonder to counteract the dehumanizing effects of city life. When subway commutes feel oppressive, let yourself wonder about fellow passengers' stories -- it transforms annoyance into curiosity and connection.
- **Spiritual Growth:** Practice sonder as a form of loving-kindness meditation. Regularly contemplating the inner lives of others develops compassion and breaks down the artificial barriers between "self" and "other."
