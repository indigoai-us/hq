# Post Hoc Fallacy

## What It Is

The post hoc fallacy (short for "post hoc ergo propter hoc" -- "after this, therefore because of this") is the logical error of assuming that because one event followed another, the first event caused the second. Just because A happened before B doesn't mean A caused B. It's mistaking correlation or coincidence for causation based solely on temporal sequence.

## Origin

This fallacy has been recognized since ancient times as a fundamental error in reasoning. The Latin phrase appears in classical logic texts, highlighting how the human mind naturally looks for causal patterns and often finds them where none exist. Our pattern-seeking brains evolved to quickly identify cause-and-effect relationships, but this useful trait sometimes leads us astray.

The fallacy is particularly dangerous because temporal sequence is often part of genuine causation -- real causes do typically precede their effects. The error lies in assuming that temporal order alone proves causation.

## Applications

- **Data Analysis:** Be especially careful when interpreting trends and correlations over time. Just because two variables change together doesn't mean one causes the other. Look for confounding variables and alternative explanations.
- **Personal Decision-Making:** Avoid assuming that good or bad outcomes were caused by your actions simply because they followed them. Sometimes success or failure results from factors beyond your control.
- **Medical and Health Choices:** Be skeptical of testimonials that claim improvement after trying a particular treatment. Recovery might be due to natural healing, other treatments, or simply the passage of time.
- **Policy Evaluation:** Recognize that improvements or problems following policy changes aren't automatically caused by those policies. Multiple factors influence social outcomes, and timing alone doesn't prove effectiveness.
