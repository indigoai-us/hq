# Gentrification

## What It Is

Gentrification is the process by which wealthier residents move into working-class or historically marginalized neighborhoods, often leading to rising property values, changing business landscapes, and the displacement of long-term residents who can no longer afford to live there. While it can bring improvements like better infrastructure and reduced crime, it often comes at the cost of community displacement and cultural erasure.

## Origin

Sociologist Ruth Glass coined the term in 1964 while studying changes in London neighborhoods. She observed how middle-class "gentry" were moving into working-class areas, renovating properties, and fundamentally altering the character of these communities. The word itself plays on the historical British class system, where "gentry" referred to the landed aristocracy.

Gentrification is a complex phenomenon driven by factors including urban development policies, housing markets, transportation improvements, and changing lifestyle preferences among affluent populations.

## Applications

- **Urban Planning:** Consider the long-term community impacts of development projects and policy changes. Well-intentioned improvements can have unintended consequences for existing residents. Seek input from current community members.
- **Real Estate Investment:** Be aware of how property investment can contribute to displacement pressures. Consider the social impact of your decisions alongside financial returns.
- **Community Engagement:** If you're moving into a neighborhood undergoing change, take time to understand and respect the existing community. Support long-standing local businesses, learn about the area's history, and engage thoughtfully.
- **Social Justice:** Recognize gentrification as a structural issue requiring systemic solutions. Support policies like affordable housing requirements, tenant protections, and community land trusts that can help neighborhoods improve without displacing residents.
