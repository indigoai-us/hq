# Survivorship Bias

## What It Is

Survivorship bias is the logical error of concentrating on successful examples while overlooking failures, leading to false conclusions about what causes success. We study successful entrepreneurs but ignore the thousands who failed, examine old buildings that lasted centuries while forgetting those that collapsed, or focus on investment winners while dismissing losers.

## Origin

The concept gained prominence during World War II when statistician Abraham Wald studied damaged aircraft returning from missions. Military officials wanted to add armor where returning planes showed bullet holes, but Wald realized they should armor the areas without holes -- those were the spots where planes couldn't survive being hit. The undamaged areas on returning planes represented critical vulnerabilities.

Wald's insight revolutionized how we think about data analysis and evidence. We can only study what survives to be studied, creating systematic blind spots about failure patterns.

## Applications

- **Career Advice:** Be skeptical of success stories that don't acknowledge failures and luck. Most "how I made it" narratives suffer from survivorship bias -- for every successful entrepreneur's playbook, thousands followed similar strategies unsuccessfully. Look for base rates and failure analysis.
- **Investment Decisions:** Recognize that financial advice often focuses on successful investments while ignoring failures. Historical returns include only companies that survived -- failed businesses disappear from indexes.
- **Learning from History:** Study failures and extinct organizations, not just successful ones. What can we learn from companies that went bankrupt, civilizations that collapsed, or strategies that didn't work? Failure analysis often provides more useful insights than success stories.
- **Personal Development:** When seeking role models or strategies, actively look for people who tried similar approaches unsuccessfully. What were they missing? What advantages did successful people have that you might lack?
