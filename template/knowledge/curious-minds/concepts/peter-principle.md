# Peter Principle

## What It Is

The Peter Principle states that in hierarchical organizations, people tend to be promoted to their level of incompetence. Employees who perform well at their current job get promoted until they reach a position where they're no longer competent, at which point promotions stop. Organizations gradually fill with people who are struggling in roles slightly beyond their capabilities.

## Origin

Management consultant Laurence J. Peter introduced the concept in his 1969 book "The Peter Principle." Peter observed that traditional promotion systems reward good performance with advancement to different roles requiring different skills, often leading capable employees into positions where they're less effective.

The principle reveals a fundamental flaw in how many organizations think about career advancement: assuming that success in one role predicts success in the next, even when the roles require completely different competencies.

## Applications

- **Career Management:** Be honest about your own competencies and interests when considering promotions. Not every advancement opportunity is right for you, even if it comes with more money or status.
- **Hiring and Promotion:** Design advancement systems that assess whether candidates have the specific skills needed for the new role, not just a track record of success in their current position.
- **Organizational Design:** Create pathways for high performers to advance without necessarily moving into management roles. Technical tracks, specialist positions, and leadership roles that don't involve traditional management can prevent the Peter Principle.
- **Team Management:** Recognize when someone might be struggling due to the Peter Principle rather than lack of effort or ability. Sometimes the kindest and most effective solution is helping them transition to a role better suited to their strengths.
