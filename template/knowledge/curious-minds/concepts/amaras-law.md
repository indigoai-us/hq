# Amara's Law

## What It Is

Amara's Law states that we tend to overestimate the effect of technology in the short run and underestimate its effect in the long run. New technologies often generate massive hype and unrealistic expectations for immediate transformation, leading to disappointment when the revolution doesn't happen overnight. Meanwhile, we fail to grasp how fundamentally these same technologies will reshape society over decades.

## Origin

Named after Stanford computer scientist Roy Amara, though he was expressing a widely observed pattern rather than conducting formal research. The law captures a consistent bias in how humans evaluate technological change -- we expect immediate dramatic impacts but miss the deeper, slower transformations that ultimately matter most.

The pattern reflects our psychological tendency to think linearly about exponential processes and to focus on immediate, visible effects while missing subtle but profound long-term changes.

## Applications

- **Technology Investment:** Avoid both the hype cycle peaks and the disillusionment troughs when evaluating new technologies. Revolutionary innovations often take longer to mature than promised but eventually transform society in ways that early predictions underestimated.
- **Career Planning:** Consider the long-term implications of emerging technologies for your industry rather than dismissing them because they haven't immediately disrupted everything.
- **Strategic Planning:** Build long-term organizational strategies that account for fundamental technological shifts while maintaining realistic expectations about short-term implementation timelines.
- **Social Adaptation:** Recognize that new technologies create social changes that unfold over generations, not just years. Consider both the immediate disruptions and the deeper cultural shifts that might emerge.
