# Cobra Effect

## What It Is

The Cobra Effect describes when a solution makes the original problem worse, often because people respond to incentives in unexpected ways. Named after a colonial Indian policy that paid people to kill cobras -- leading people to breed cobras for the bounty -- it represents the unintended consequences that arise when well-meaning interventions create perverse incentives.

## Origin

The term comes from an anecdote about British colonial rule in India. To reduce the cobra population, the government offered a bounty for dead cobras. Initially, this worked, but then enterprising people began breeding cobras to kill for the reward. When the government discovered this and cancelled the program, the breeders released their now-worthless cobras, making the original problem worse than before.

Whether or not this specific story is true, it perfectly illustrates a common pattern where solutions backfire due to human behavioral responses. People adapt to new rules and incentives in ways that policymakers rarely anticipate.

## Applications

- **Policy Design:** Before implementing new rules or incentives, consider how people might game the system. What behaviors are you actually rewarding versus what you intend to reward?
- **Management:** Be careful about metrics and KPIs that might encourage counterproductive behavior. If you measure calls handled per hour, don't be surprised if customer service quality suffers. People optimize for what's measured, not necessarily what's intended.
- **Personal Goal-Setting:** Notice when your own systems and rewards might be creating perverse incentives. If you reward yourself for exercise with food treats, you might be undermining your health goals.
- **Social Media Strategy:** Understand how platform algorithms can create cobra effects -- optimizing for engagement might reward outrageous content over valuable content, or pursuing follower count might lead to buying fake followers that hurt authentic engagement.
