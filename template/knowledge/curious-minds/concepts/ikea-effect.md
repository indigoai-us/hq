# IKEA Effect

## What It Is

The IKEA Effect is the cognitive bias where people place disproportionately high value on products they partially created themselves, regardless of the quality of the end result. Named after the Swedish furniture company known for self-assembly products, this effect explains why people often overvalue things they've built, cooked, or made, even when the outcome is objectively inferior to professionally made alternatives.

## Origin

Harvard Business School researchers Michael Norton, Daniel Mochon, and Dan Ariely identified and named this bias in 2011 through experiments where participants built simple IKEA products, folded origami, or assembled Lego sets. People consistently valued their own creations more highly than identical items made by others, even when their work was clearly amateurish.

The effect appears to stem from the psychological investment we make in creating something -- the effort and attention involved creates emotional attachment that increases perceived value.

## Applications

- **Product Design:** Consider incorporating elements that require customer participation or customization. When people invest effort in personalizing or assembling products, they often develop stronger attachment and satisfaction.
- **Team Building:** Use collaborative creation projects to build investment and ownership in team outcomes. When people participate in creating solutions, they're more likely to value and support the results.
- **Education:** Engage students in creating their own learning materials, projects, or explanations rather than just consuming pre-made content. This investment in creation often leads to deeper understanding.
- **Personal Projects:** Recognize that your attachment to things you've made or built might exceed their objective value. This isn't necessarily bad -- the satisfaction of creation has its own worth -- but be aware of this bias.
