# Chronocentrism

## What It Is

Chronocentrism is the assumption that one's own time period represents the pinnacle of human progress, development, or moral advancement. It's the belief that contemporary values, knowledge, and ways of life are superior to those of the past and will remain the best into the future. This temporal arrogance leads to dismissing historical perspectives and assuming current practices are the final word on human civilization.

## Origin

The term combines "chrono" (time) and "centrism" (centered on), following the pattern of other bias terms like ethnocentrism. While the word is relatively recent, the concept addresses a longstanding human tendency to view one's own era as uniquely enlightened or advanced compared to supposedly primitive past and uncertain future.

Chronocentrism reflects broader patterns of temporal bias in human thinking. We tend to view historical people as less intelligent or moral than ourselves while imagining that current knowledge and values represent permanent achievements.

## Applications

- **Historical Understanding:** Approach past cultures with humility, recognizing that they solved problems and created value in ways we might not fully understand or appreciate.
- **Future Planning:** Remain open to the possibility that future generations might view current practices as misguided or harmful. What seems obviously correct today might be seen as a historical mistake.
- **Cultural Appreciation:** Resist the assumption that technological or economic development automatically represents human progress. Different cultures and time periods might excel in areas that current metrics don't capture.
- **Personal Humility:** Recognize that your current beliefs and practices will likely seem incomplete or flawed to your future self. This can inspire intellectual humility and openness to continued growth.
