# Gaslighting

## What It Is

Gaslighting is a form of psychological manipulation where someone makes you question your own perception of reality, memory, or judgment. The perpetrator systematically denies events you remember, contradicts your experiences, and suggests you're confused, overly sensitive, or mentally unstable. Over time, this can make you doubt your own sanity and become dependent on the manipulator's version of reality.

## Origin

The term comes from the 1944 film "Gaslight," where a husband manipulates his wife into believing she's going insane by dimming gas lights and denying they're flickering, among other deceptions. The movie dramatized psychological abuse tactics that had existed long before they had a name.

Gaslighting can be intentional or unconscious, ranging from deliberate manipulation by narcissistic abusers to well-meaning people who genuinely believe their version of events is correct. The effect on victims is similar regardless of intent: confusion, self-doubt, and erosion of confidence in their own perceptions.

## Applications

- **Relationship Recognition:** Trust your own perceptions and feelings when someone consistently denies your experiences or makes you feel crazy for having reasonable concerns. Keep a journal of events to maintain clarity about what actually happened versus what others claim.
- **Workplace Dynamics:** Recognize gaslighting in professional settings -- managers who deny promises they made, colleagues who rewrite history about project decisions, or organizations that claim policies don't exist when you've seen the documentation. Document important interactions.
- **Media Literacy:** Be aware of collective gaslighting, where institutions or leaders deny widely observed events or redefine commonly understood terms. Maintain connection to reliable information sources and trusted witnesses to reality.
- **Self-Advocacy:** If you find yourself constantly apologizing, doubting your memory, or feeling confused in certain relationships, consider whether gaslighting might be occurring. Seek outside perspectives from trusted friends or professionals who can help validate your experiences.
