# Moral Hazard

## What It Is

Moral hazard occurs when someone takes greater risks because they don't bear the full consequences of their actions -- usually because someone else will pay for negative outcomes. Banks that are "too big to fail" might take excessive risks knowing taxpayers will bail them out, or people with comprehensive insurance might be less careful about preventing accidents. The safety net itself changes behavior in ways that increase the likelihood of needing it.

## Origin

The term originated in 17th-century insurance, where insurers worried that people might be careless with insured property or even deliberately cause damage to collect insurance money. The concept expanded beyond insurance to economics, politics, and organizational behavior as economists recognized the broader pattern.

Moral hazard reveals a fundamental tension in creating safety nets and protection systems -- the very mechanisms designed to reduce risk can inadvertently encourage riskier behavior.

## Applications

- **Organizational Management:** Design accountability systems that ensure people bear appropriate consequences for their decisions. When managers or employees can make risky choices that others will pay for, it creates moral hazard.
- **Financial Planning:** Be aware of how insurance, guarantees, or safety nets might change your own risk tolerance. Having protection is valuable, but don't let it lead to carelessness.
- **Policy Design:** Consider how social programs, regulations, or interventions might create unintended behavioral changes. Effective policies need to provide protection while maintaining appropriate incentives.
- **Personal Relationships:** Notice when you might be creating moral hazard by consistently rescuing others from the consequences of their choices. Sometimes helping people avoid consequences prevents them from learning and growing.
