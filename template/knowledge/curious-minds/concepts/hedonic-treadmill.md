# Hedonic Treadmill

## What It Is

The hedonic treadmill describes our tendency to quickly return to a baseline level of happiness despite positive or negative life events. Win the lottery, get promoted, or buy your dream house, and you'll experience a temporary boost in happiness -- but within months, you'll likely be back to your previous emotional baseline. The same applies to negative events: most people adapt to setbacks and return to their normal happiness levels faster than expected.

## Origin

Psychologists Philip Brickman and Donald Campbell coined the term in 1971, building on earlier research into adaptation-level theory. The metaphor suggests we're running on a treadmill -- constantly striving for happiness but staying in the same place emotionally.

Landmark studies of lottery winners and paraplegics found that both groups returned closer to their baseline happiness levels than researchers expected. This doesn't mean circumstances don't matter, but it suggests that internal factors play a larger role in long-term happiness than external conditions.

## Applications

- **Financial Planning:** Recognize that earning more money won't permanently increase your happiness beyond meeting basic needs. This understanding can help you make more thoughtful decisions about work-life balance and spending priorities rather than constantly chasing the next pay raise.
- **Goal Setting:** Set goals for growth and contribution rather than just acquisition. Experiences, relationships, and meaningful work tend to provide more lasting satisfaction than material purchases because they're harder to adapt to completely.
- **Consumer Decisions:** Before major purchases, ask yourself honestly how long the happiness boost will last. That expensive car might feel exciting for a few months, but will it still bring joy in two years? Often, smaller, more frequent pleasures provide better value.
- **Spiritual Practice:** Use awareness of the hedonic treadmill to cultivate gratitude and presence. If happiness doesn't come from external circumstances, it must come from your relationship with whatever circumstances you're in. This is the foundation of most contemplative traditions.
