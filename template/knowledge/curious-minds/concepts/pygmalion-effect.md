# Pygmalion Effect

## What It Is

The Pygmalion Effect describes how high expectations lead to improved performance, while low expectations lead to decreased performance. When teachers expect certain students to excel, those students actually do perform better -- not because of their inherent ability, but because expectations create subtle changes in behavior that become self-fulfilling prophecies.

## Origin

Named after the Greek myth of Pygmalion, who fell in love with a statue he carved and whose love brought it to life. Psychologists Robert Rosenthal and Lenore Jacobson demonstrated the effect in their famous 1968 "Bloomers" study. They randomly designated certain students as likely to show dramatic improvement and told teachers about these predictions. By year's end, these randomly selected students actually did show greater gains than their peers.

The effect works through subtle behavioral changes: higher expectations lead to more attention, encouragement, feedback, and challenging opportunities, which in turn improve actual performance.

## Applications

- **Management:** Communicate high expectations clearly to your team members, but ensure they're realistic and accompanied by appropriate support. Your belief in someone's potential can literally help them achieve it, but setting impossible standards creates pressure rather than empowerment.
- **Parenting:** Be mindful of the messages you send children about their capabilities. Praising effort and growth rather than fixed traits helps create positive expectations without the pressure of living up to labels like "the smart one" or "the athletic one."
- **Self-Development:** Notice the expectations you set for yourself. Self-fulfilling prophecies work internally too -- if you expect to fail at something, you're more likely to give up early or not try your hardest. Cultivate realistic optimism about your own potential.
- **Educational Settings:** Whether you're teaching, training, or mentoring, remember that your expectations communicate more than you realize. People can sense whether you believe in their potential, and they tend to rise or fall to meet those expectations.
