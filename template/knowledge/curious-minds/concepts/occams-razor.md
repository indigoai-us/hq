# Occam's Razor

## What It Is

Occam's Razor is the principle that the simplest explanation is usually the correct one. When faced with multiple possible explanations for a phenomenon, choose the one that requires the fewest assumptions. It's not about finding the most obvious answer, but the one that introduces the least complexity while still accounting for the available evidence.

## Origin

Named after 14th-century English philosopher William of Ockham (the spelling evolved over time), though the principle itself is much older. Ockham wrote "plurality should not be posited without necessity" -- essentially arguing against unnecessarily complex explanations.

The "razor" metaphor suggests cutting away superfluous elements. The principle has become fundamental to scientific method, where simpler theories are preferred over complex ones when both explain the data equally well. However, Occam's Razor is a heuristic, not an absolute law -- sometimes reality is genuinely complex.

## Applications

- **Problem Diagnosis:** When systems fail or problems arise at work, start with the simplest possible causes before exploring elaborate explanations. Is the printer broken, or is it just out of paper? Often the mundane answer is correct.
- **Relationship Conflicts:** Before assuming complex psychological motivations for someone's behavior, consider simpler explanations. Maybe they're not deliberately ignoring you -- maybe they're just overwhelmed, tired, or didn't see your message.
- **Decision-Making:** When choosing between strategies or solutions, favor approaches that require fewer moving parts, assumptions, or dependencies. Simpler plans are often more robust and easier to execute.
- **Self-Reflection:** Apply Occam's Razor to your own thoughts and emotions. If you're feeling anxious, consider simple explanations (tired, hungry, overwhelmed) before diving into complex psychological analysis. Sometimes the straightforward answer is the right one.
