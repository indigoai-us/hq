# Peak-End Rule

## What It Is

The Peak-End Rule describes how people judge experiences largely based on how they felt at the most intense point (peak) and at the end, rather than the total duration or average quality of the experience. A painful medical procedure that ends gently will be remembered more favorably than one that ends abruptly, even if the gentle ending makes the total experience longer.

## Origin

Psychologist Daniel Kahneman discovered this pattern through experiments in the 1990s, including studies where participants rated experiences of immersing their hands in cold water. People preferred experiences that lasted longer but ended less painfully, contradicting the logical assumption that shorter painful experiences would be better.

The rule reveals how memory differs from real-time experience. We don't remember experiences as integrated wholes but as story-like narratives dominated by peak moments and endings.

## Applications

- **Customer Experience:** Design service interactions with strong attention to peak moments and endings. How customers feel during their most intense moment and when they leave will disproportionately influence their overall impression.
- **Event Planning:** Focus on creating memorable peak experiences and ensuring positive endings rather than maintaining consistent quality throughout.
- **Healthcare:** Pay special attention to how medical procedures and appointments end. Patients will judge their care significantly based on final interactions.
- **Personal Relationships:** Recognize that people will remember your interactions based on the most intense moments and how they ended. Invest in creating positive peaks and graceful conclusions.
