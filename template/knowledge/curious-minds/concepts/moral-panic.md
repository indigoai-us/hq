# Moral Panic

## What It Is

A moral panic is a period of widespread anxiety and fear about a perceived threat to social order, often disproportionate to the actual danger posed. During moral panics, public concern becomes amplified through media coverage and social pressure, leading to calls for immediate action against a supposed menace. The panic typically focuses on a particular group, behavior, or cultural phenomenon that becomes scapegoated for broader social anxieties.

## Origin

Sociologist Stanley Cohen coined the term in his 1972 study "Folk Devils and Moral Panics," analyzing British media coverage of conflicts between Mods and Rockers youth subcultures. Cohen identified common patterns: the media amplifies minor incidents, creates folk devils (villainized groups), and generates public demand for crackdowns that often exceed the actual threat.

Moral panics often reflect deeper social tensions and uncertainties. They tend to emerge during periods of social change when established norms feel threatened.

## Applications

- **Media Consumption:** Recognize when news coverage might be amplifying moral panic rather than providing proportionate coverage of actual risks. Look for evidence-based reporting versus emotional appeals.
- **Policy Making:** Be cautious about creating hasty policies during periods of intense public concern. Moral panics often lead to overreaction and policies that cause more harm than the original problem.
- **Social Movements:** Distinguish between legitimate social concerns and moral panic dynamics. While some issues deserve urgent attention, be wary of movements that demonize particular groups.
- **Personal Judgment:** Notice when you might be caught up in moral panic thinking -- feeling intense anxiety about threats that may be statistically small or poorly understood. Seek out balanced information.
