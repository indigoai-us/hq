# Functional Fixedness

## What It Is

Functional fixedness is the cognitive bias that limits a person to using objects only in the way they are traditionally used. It's the mental block that prevents you from seeing a hammer as a paperweight, a newspaper as gift wrap, or a coin as a screwdriver. This bias can prevent creative problem-solving by blinding us to alternative uses for available resources.

## Origin

Gestalt psychologist Karl Duncker first described functional fixedness in 1945 through his famous "candle problem." Participants were given a candle, matches, and a box of thumbtacks, and asked to attach the candle to a wall so it could burn without dripping wax. The solution required using the thumbtack box as a candle holder, but many people couldn't see past the box's "function" as a container.

The bias reveals how our mental categories and past experiences can limit creative thinking. When we strongly associate objects with particular functions, we may miss opportunities to use them in novel ways.

## Applications

- **Creative Problem-Solving:** When facing challenges, deliberately consider unconventional uses for available resources. Ask yourself: "What else could this be used for?"
- **Resource Management:** Look for ways existing assets, skills, or systems might serve multiple purposes. A conference room might become a meditation space, a marketing team might help with customer service.
- **Innovation:** Break free from functional fixedness by studying how different industries or cultures use similar tools. Cross-pollination between fields often leads to breakthrough innovations.
- **Educational Settings:** Teach children to think flexibly about objects and concepts by encouraging play and exploration that goes beyond traditional uses.
