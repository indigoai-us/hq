# Jevons Paradox

## What It Is

Jevons Paradox describes the counterintuitive phenomenon where improving the efficiency of a resource actually leads to increased consumption of that resource, rather than conservation. Make cars more fuel-efficient, and people drive more. Create energy-saving appliances, and people buy bigger houses filled with more gadgets. The efficiency gains get overwhelmed by increased usage, defeating the original conservation purpose.

## Origin

Named after English economist William Stanley Jevons, who observed in 1865 that improvements in coal efficiency led to increased coal consumption rather than conservation. As steam engines became more efficient, coal became cheaper to use, spurring greater demand across more applications.

The paradox challenges the intuitive assumption that efficiency automatically leads to conservation. Instead, it reveals how economic incentives can overwhelm technological improvements. When something becomes cheaper or easier to use, people tend to use more of it, not less.

## Applications

- **Environmental Policy:** Recognize that efficiency improvements alone may not solve resource consumption problems. Fuel efficiency standards might need to be paired with carbon pricing or other measures that address the total consumption rebound effect.
- **Personal Productivity:** Be aware that productivity tools and time-saving techniques might lead to taking on more work rather than having more leisure time. Efficiency gains often get absorbed by expanded expectations and commitments.
- **Technology Design:** When creating more efficient systems, consider how usage patterns might change in response. A faster internet connection doesn't just make current activities quicker -- it enables entirely new forms of data consumption.
- **Financial Planning:** Understand that cost-saving measures might lead to lifestyle inflation rather than actual savings. Getting a more fuel-efficient car might result in more driving, not lower transportation costs. Plan for behavioral changes when calculating potential savings.
