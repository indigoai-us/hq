# Echoism

## What It Is

Echoism is the opposite of narcissism -- a pattern of behavior characterized by an excessive need to avoid attention, difficulty expressing one's own needs, and a tendency to focus entirely on others' needs while neglecting one's own. People with echoist traits often feel guilty for taking up space, struggle to accept compliments, and may become invisible in relationships and social situations.

## Origin

Psychologist Craig Malkin coined the term around 2015, drawing on the Greek myth of Echo, who was cursed to only repeat others' words and eventually faded away until only her voice remained. Malkin observed that while narcissism receives significant attention, the opposite extreme -- people who consistently self-efface and avoid attention -- was largely unnamed and understudied.

The concept emerged from clinical observation that some people develop pathological patterns of self-denial and other-focus, often as a response to narcissistic family dynamics.

## Applications

- **Relationship Dynamics:** Recognize echoist patterns in yourself or others -- consistently deferring to others' preferences, feeling uncomfortable receiving attention, or automatically assuming others' needs are more important.
- **Workplace Settings:** Notice when echoist employees consistently undervalue their contributions, avoid taking credit, or struggle to advocate for themselves.
- **Self-Advocacy:** If you have echoist tendencies, practice expressing your needs and preferences in small, low-stakes situations. Having needs and desires doesn't make you selfish -- it makes you human.
- **Parenting:** Help children develop healthy self-regard by validating their feelings, encouraging them to express preferences, and teaching them that their needs matter alongside others' needs.
