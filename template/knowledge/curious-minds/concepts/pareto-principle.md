# Pareto Principle (80/20 Rule)

## What It Is

The Pareto Principle, commonly known as the 80/20 rule, states that roughly 80% of effects come from 20% of causes. Originally observed in economics (80% of wealth owned by 20% of people), the principle appears everywhere: 20% of customers generate 80% of revenue, 20% of bugs cause 80% of software crashes, 20% of your clothes get worn 80% of the time. It's a reminder that most outcomes are driven by a small number of inputs.

## Origin

Named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, who noticed in 1896 that 80% of Italy's land was owned by 20% of the population. The pattern appeared so frequently across different domains that it became recognized as a fundamental principle of unequal distribution.

Management consultant Joseph Juran later popularized the concept in business, calling it the "vital few and trivial many." The exact ratio isn't always 80/20 -- it might be 90/10 or 70/30 -- but the core insight remains: a small number of factors typically drive most results.

## Applications

- **Time Management:** Identify the 20% of activities that produce 80% of your results, then focus more energy there. This might mean spending less time on busy work and more on high-impact projects, or recognizing which meetings actually matter.
- **Business Strategy:** Focus on your most valuable customers rather than trying to serve everyone equally. Understanding which products, services, or market segments drive most of your profit allows for better resource allocation.
- **Personal Relationships:** Recognize that a small number of people likely provide most of your emotional support and meaningful interaction. Invest more deeply in these vital relationships rather than spreading yourself thin across many superficial connections.
- **Problem-Solving:** When facing complex challenges, look for the few root causes that create most of the problems. Addressing these core issues often provides more leverage than tackling symptoms broadly.
