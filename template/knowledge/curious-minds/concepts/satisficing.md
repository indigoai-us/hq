# Satisficing

## What It Is

Satisficing is the strategy of seeking solutions that are "good enough" rather than optimal. Instead of exhaustively searching for the perfect option, you set criteria for what would be satisfactory and choose the first alternative that meets those standards. It's the difference between finding the best possible restaurant and finding a restaurant that's clean, reasonably priced, and serves food you like.

## Origin

Economist Herbert Simon coined the term in 1956, combining "satisfy" and "suffice." Simon argued that humans don't actually optimize in most decisions -- we satisfice because the cost of finding the perfect solution usually outweighs the benefit. He won a Nobel Prize partly for this insight, which challenged classical economic assumptions about rational decision-making.

Satisficing explains much of human behavior better than optimization models. We have limited time, information, and cognitive resources, so "good enough" is often genuinely rational even when "perfect" is theoretically possible.

## Applications

- **Decision-Making:** Use satisficing consciously for decisions where the stakes are relatively low. Spending three hours researching the perfect lunch spot is usually inefficient -- set basic criteria and pick the first option that meets them. Save optimization for decisions that truly matter.
- **Product Development:** Understand that customers often satisfice rather than optimize. They don't need the best possible product -- they need one that adequately solves their problem at an acceptable price with reasonable convenience.
- **Career Planning:** Apply satisficing to job searches and career moves. Define what constitutes a good opportunity rather than holding out indefinitely for the perfect role. Good enough today can become great through your own development and contributions.
- **Perfectionism Management:** If you struggle with perfectionism, practice satisficing deliberately in low-stakes situations. Learning when "good enough" is actually good enough can free up mental energy for areas where excellence truly matters.
