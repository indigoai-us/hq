# Ikigai

## What It Is

Ikigai is a Japanese concept meaning "reason for being" or "purpose in life." It represents the intersection of what you love, what you're good at, what the world needs, and what you can be paid for. It's not just about career satisfaction -- it's about finding deep meaning that makes you want to get up in the morning, regardless of external circumstances.

## Origin

The word combines "iki" (life) and "gai" (worth or value). While Western interpretations often focus on the career-oriented four-circle Venn diagram, traditional Japanese understanding of ikigai is broader and more spiritual. In Okinawa, where the concept is deeply embedded in culture, ikigai often refers to small, everyday pleasures and social connections rather than grand career purposes.

Research on Okinawan centenarians suggests that having a clear sense of ikigai contributes to longevity and well-being. However, the concept doesn't require finding one perfect life purpose -- it can evolve and include multiple sources of meaning.

## Applications

- **Career Development:** Use ikigai as a framework for career decisions, but don't expect perfect alignment immediately. Focus on gradually moving toward work that incorporates more elements of your ikigai rather than waiting for the perfect opportunity.
- **Life Transitions:** During retirement, career changes, or major life shifts, revisit your ikigai. What gives your life meaning beyond professional achievement? How can you maintain purpose when external roles change?
- **Daily Practice:** Find ikigai in small, everyday activities. It might be mentoring junior colleagues, perfecting a craft, contributing to your community, or simply being present for loved ones. Purpose doesn't have to be grandiose to be meaningful.
- **Spiritual Development:** Use ikigai reflection as a meditation practice. Regularly examine what brings you alive, what you can contribute, and how your unique gifts serve the world. This awareness can guide decisions both large and small.
