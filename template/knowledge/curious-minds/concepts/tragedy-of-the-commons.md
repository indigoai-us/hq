# Tragedy of the Commons

## What It Is

The Tragedy of the Commons describes how shared resources get depleted when individuals acting rationally in their own self-interest collectively create an outcome that's bad for everyone. Each person has an incentive to use more of the common resource, but when everyone does this, the resource gets destroyed. Think of overfishing, traffic congestion, or climate change -- individually rational decisions that create collectively irrational outcomes.

## Origin

Ecologist Garrett Hardin popularized the concept in his influential 1968 essay, though the underlying idea is much older. Hardin illustrated the problem with medieval common grazing lands: each herder benefits from adding another cow to the commons, but when all herders do this, the land becomes overgrazed and useless to everyone.

The tragedy occurs because the benefits of resource use are private and immediate, while the costs are shared and often delayed.

## Applications

- **Environmental Policy:** Understand that appealing to individual responsibility alone won't solve commons problems like climate change or pollution. Effective solutions usually require collective action through regulation, pricing mechanisms, or social institutions that align individual and collective interests.
- **Organizational Resources:** Recognize commons problems in workplace settings -- shared equipment, meeting rooms, or budgets that get overused because everyone has incentives to claim more than their fair share.
- **Digital Platforms:** Notice how online commons like comment sections, social media platforms, or shared digital spaces can degrade when individual users prioritize personal visibility over collective discourse quality.
- **Personal Relationships:** Be aware of relationship commons -- shared time, emotional energy, or household resources where individual optimization can harm the collective good.
