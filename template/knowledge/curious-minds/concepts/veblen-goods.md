# Veblen Goods

## What It Is

Veblen goods are luxury items that become more desirable as their price increases, violating the normal economic law that higher prices reduce demand. These products derive their value partly from their exclusivity and the status they confer. A $50,000 handbag or $500 bottle of wine appeals to buyers precisely because of its outrageous cost -- the price itself is part of the product.

## Origin

Thorstein Veblen introduced the concept in his 1899 book "The Theory of the Leisure Class," where he described "conspicuous consumption" -- the practice of buying expensive goods to display wealth and social status rather than for their practical utility. Veblen observed that for certain products, high prices actually increase demand by signaling exclusivity and prestige.

This phenomenon occurs because some consumers use purchases to communicate their social position. When something becomes too affordable, it loses its value as a status symbol.

## Applications

- **Brand Strategy:** Understand that some luxury brands maintain their appeal partly through high pricing. Lowering prices might increase short-term sales but could destroy long-term brand value if exclusivity is part of the product's appeal.
- **Personal Finance:** Recognize when you're attracted to products partly because of their price tag rather than their actual value. Ask yourself whether you want something because it's genuinely superior or because its cost signals status.
- **Social Psychology:** Notice how Veblen goods reveal our deep human need for social signaling and status. Even people who consciously reject materialism often find themselves drawn to certain expensive items that communicate their values or identity.
- **Market Analysis:** Be aware that normal price-demand relationships don't apply to all products. In luxury markets, prestige categories, and status-driven industries, higher prices can actually increase demand.
