# Simpson's Paradox

## What It Is

Simpson's Paradox occurs when a statistical trend appears in different groups of data but disappears or reverses when the groups are combined. For example, a treatment might be more effective than a control in both men and women separately, but when you combine the data, the control appears more effective overall. This paradox reveals how aggregating data can create misleading conclusions if important variables are ignored.

## Origin

Named after statistician Edward Simpson who described it in 1951, though the phenomenon was noted earlier by other researchers. The paradox highlights fundamental challenges in statistical analysis and causal inference -- how grouping and aggregating data can obscure rather than clarify important relationships.

Simpson's Paradox often occurs when a confounding variable influences both the grouping of data and the outcome being measured.

## Applications

- **Data Analysis:** Always consider how different groupings might reveal different patterns in your data. What appears to be a clear trend in aggregate data might disappear or reverse when you examine relevant subgroups.
- **Research Interpretation:** Be skeptical of studies that don't account for important demographic, temporal, or contextual differences between groups.
- **Business Intelligence:** When analyzing customer data, sales performance, or operational metrics, examine trends within relevant subgroups before drawing conclusions from overall numbers.
- **Social Policy:** Recognize that policies showing positive effects overall might harm specific groups, or interventions that appear ineffective generally might be highly beneficial for particular populations.
