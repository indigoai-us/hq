# Invisible Gorilla

## What It Is

The Invisible Gorilla refers to a famous psychology experiment demonstrating "inattentional blindness" -- our tendency to miss obvious things when our attention is focused elsewhere. Participants watching people pass basketballs completely failed to notice a person in a gorilla suit walking through the scene. We think we see everything important, but we're actually missing much of what happens around us.

## Origin

The experiment was conducted by psychologists Daniel Simons and Christopher Chabris in 1999, building on earlier work on selective attention. They showed that when people concentrate on a specific task -- counting basketball passes -- they can miss dramatic events happening right in front of them.

The study revealed that inattentional blindness affects everyone, not just inattentive people. Our brains have limited processing capacity, so focusing on one thing necessarily means ignoring others.

## Applications

- **Safety Awareness:** Recognize that focused attention creates blind spots in potentially dangerous situations. Drivers texting, surgeons concentrating on procedures, or pilots monitoring instruments might miss critical environmental changes. Build systems that account for inattentional blindness.
- **Business Strategy:** Understand that organizations focused on specific metrics or goals might miss important market changes, competitor moves, or internal problems. Create diverse feedback systems and devil's advocate roles to catch what focused attention misses.
- **Personal Relationships:** Notice when intense focus on work, goals, or problems makes you miss important signals from family and friends. The people closest to you might be "invisible gorillas" -- obvious but unnoticed because your attention is elsewhere.
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Use awareness of inattentional blindness to cultivate broader awareness. Regular meditation and mindfulness exercises can help you notice more of what's actually happening around you rather than just what you're focused on.
