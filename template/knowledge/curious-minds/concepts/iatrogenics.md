# Iatrogenics

## What It Is

Iatrogenics refers to harm caused by medical treatment itself -- when the cure becomes worse than the disease or when interventions create new problems. This can range from medication side effects and surgical complications to overdiagnosis and unnecessary procedures. The term captures the paradox that healing systems, despite good intentions, sometimes cause the very suffering they're meant to prevent.

## Origin

The word comes from Greek "iatros" (physician) and "genesis" (origin), literally meaning "physician-caused." While doctors have long recognized that treatments can cause harm, the systematic study of iatrogenics emerged in the 20th century as medical interventions became more powerful and complex.

The concept has expanded beyond medicine to describe unintended harm caused by any intervention meant to help -- whether in psychotherapy, education, social work, or organizational consulting.

## Applications

- **Healthcare Decisions:** Always consider the potential for iatrogenic harm when evaluating medical treatments. Sometimes the risks of intervention outweigh the benefits, especially for mild conditions.
- **Organizational Consulting:** Be aware that business interventions -- restructuring, new processes, culture change initiatives -- can create unintended negative consequences even when well-intentioned.
- **Parenting and Education:** Recognize that efforts to help children can sometimes backfire. Overprotective parenting or pushing too hard academically can create the problems they're meant to prevent.
- **Personal Development:** Notice when self-improvement efforts might be creating iatrogenic effects -- stress from productivity systems, anxiety from constant self-monitoring, or relationship problems from aggressive personal growth programs.
