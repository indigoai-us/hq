# Frisson

## What It Is

Frisson is that sudden wave of excitement, emotion, or thrill that gives you goosebumps or sends chills down your spine. It's the physical sensation you get from beautiful music, an inspiring speech, a spectacular view, or an emotionally powerful moment in a film. The word literally means "shiver" in French, capturing that distinctive combination of emotional intensity and physical response.

## Origin

While the physical sensation has always existed, the scientific study of frisson is relatively recent. Researchers have found that frisson occurs when we encounter something that violates our expectations in a pleasant way -- a surprising chord change in music, an unexpected plot twist, or a moment of transcendent beauty.

Not everyone experiences frisson equally. Studies suggest that people who are more open to new experiences and have stronger emotional responses to art are more likely to get frisson. The phenomenon appears to involve the release of dopamine and activation of reward centers in the brain.

## Applications

- **Artistic Creation:** Understand that frisson often comes from the skillful violation of expectations. Whether you're writing, composing, designing, or presenting, consider how you can create moments that surprise and move your audience in unexpected ways.
- **Personal Well-being:** Pay attention to what triggers frisson for you and seek out those experiences regularly. Whether it's certain types of music, natural settings, or emotional stories, these moments of transcendence contribute to psychological well-being.
- **Leadership Communication:** Recognize that the most memorable speeches and presentations often include frisson moments -- emotional peaks that create lasting impact.
- **Mindfulness Practice:** Use frisson as a gateway to presence and emotional awareness. When you notice that chill-inducing moment, pay attention to what's happening in your body and mind.
