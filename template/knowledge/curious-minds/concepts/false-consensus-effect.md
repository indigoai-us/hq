# False Consensus Effect

## What It Is

The False Consensus Effect is the tendency to overestimate how much other people share your beliefs, values, and behaviors. If you enjoy hiking, you're likely to assume more people enjoy hiking than actually do. If you support a particular political position, you'll probably overestimate how popular that position is. We use ourselves as the baseline for normal and assume others are more similar to us than they actually are.

## Origin

Social psychologists Lee Ross, David Greene, and Pamela House identified this bias in 1977 through experiments where participants predicted how others would respond to various scenarios. Consistently, people assumed others would make the same choices they would make, even when presented with evidence of diverse preferences.

The effect occurs because we have direct access to our own thoughts and feelings but can only guess about others' inner experiences. We also tend to associate with people similar to ourselves, creating echo chambers that reinforce the illusion that our perspectives are widely shared.

## Applications

- **Marketing and Product Development:** Don't assume your preferences represent your target market. Conduct research to understand how your customers actually think and behave rather than projecting your own assumptions.
- **Political Understanding:** Recognize that your social circle likely doesn't represent the broader political landscape. Actively seek out diverse perspectives and polling data.
- **Team Management:** When making decisions that affect others, gather input rather than assuming team members share your priorities and preferences.
- **Social Relationships:** Practice intellectual humility by regularly checking your assumptions about what others think and feel. Ask questions and listen carefully rather than assuming you know how others will react.
