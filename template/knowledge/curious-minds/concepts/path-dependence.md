# Path Dependence

## What It Is

Path dependence describes how past decisions and historical accidents continue to shape present options, even when they no longer make sense. We're locked into certain patterns not because they're optimal, but because the cost of switching has become too high. The QWERTY keyboard layout, designed to prevent mechanical typewriter jams, persists in our digital age because everyone already knows it, despite more efficient alternatives.

## Origin

The concept emerged from economics and institutional theory in the 1980s, particularly through the work of economist Brian Arthur and political scientist Paul Pierson. They showed how small, seemingly random early events can have lasting consequences by creating self-reinforcing patterns that become difficult to escape.

Path dependence explains why inefficient systems often persist: not because they're the best solution, but because the switching costs -- retraining, infrastructure changes, coordination problems -- make change seem impossible even when everyone agrees the current system is suboptimal.

## Applications

- **Organizational Change:** Recognize that resistance to new systems often stems from path dependence rather than stubbornness. People and organizations get locked into existing processes not because they love them, but because changing requires coordinated effort and temporary inefficiency.
- **Technology Adoption:** Understand why superior technologies sometimes fail to achieve widespread adoption. The installed base of existing technology, user habits, and network effects can keep inferior systems in place long after better alternatives exist.
- **Personal Habits:** Notice how past choices create momentum that shapes future options. Career paths, relationship patterns, and daily routines often persist through path dependence -- not because they're ideal, but because change requires disrupting established patterns.
- **Policy Design:** Consider how current policies create path dependence for future decisions. Well-intentioned programs can become entrenched not because they work well, but because removing them becomes politically or economically difficult over time.
