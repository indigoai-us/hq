# Flynn Effect

## What It Is

The Flynn Effect describes the substantial increase in average IQ scores observed across populations over the 20th century. Each generation has scored higher on intelligence tests than the previous one, with average IQ gains of about 3 points per decade. This suggests that people today are measurably more intelligent than their grandparents, at least according to the cognitive abilities measured by IQ tests.

## Origin

Political scientist James Flynn documented this pattern in the 1980s while studying intelligence test data across different countries and time periods. The effect was so consistent and surprising that it was named after him, though Flynn himself was puzzled by the findings and their implications.

Various explanations have been proposed: better nutrition, more education, increased cognitive complexity in modern environments, improved test-taking familiarity, or changes in what kinds of intelligence are valued and developed. The effect appears to be slowing or reversing in some developed countries.

## Applications

- **Education:** Recognize that cognitive abilities can be significantly influenced by environmental factors like nutrition, education quality, and cultural emphasis on abstract thinking. This supports investments in educational systems and early childhood development.
- **Historical Perspective:** Be cautious about assuming people in the past were less intelligent than people today. They may have scored lower on modern IQ tests, but they possessed different types of intelligence adapted to their environments.
- **Talent Development:** Understand that intelligence is more malleable than often assumed. Environmental enrichment, challenging experiences, and cultural expectations can significantly influence cognitive development.
- **Research Methodology:** Consider how changing populations affect longitudinal studies and comparisons across time periods.
