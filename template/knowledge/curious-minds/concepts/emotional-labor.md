# Emotional Labor

## What It Is

Emotional labor is the process of managing feelings and expressions to fulfill the emotional requirements of a job or relationship. It's the work of appearing cheerful when serving difficult customers, staying calm during tense negotiations, or providing comfort to others while suppressing your own stress. This invisible labor involves both regulating your own emotions and managing others' emotional experiences.

## Origin

Sociologist Arlie Hochschild introduced the concept in her 1983 book "The Managed Heart," studying flight attendants who were required to display constant warmth and concern regardless of their actual feelings. Hochschild distinguished between surface acting (faking emotions) and deep acting (actually changing your feelings to match requirements).

The concept has expanded beyond workplace contexts to describe unpaid emotional work in relationships and families -- often disproportionately performed by women. This includes remembering important dates, managing social calendars, mediating conflicts, and maintaining family emotional well-being.

## Applications

- **Workplace Awareness:** Recognize the emotional labor required in service jobs and be more patient with workers who must maintain professional demeanor despite challenging conditions.
- **Relationship Balance:** Notice the distribution of emotional labor in your personal relationships. Are you doing a fair share of the work to maintain emotional connections and manage household emotional dynamics?
- **Management:** Acknowledge that many roles require significant emotional labor and factor this into job design, compensation, and support systems.
- **Self-Care:** Recognize when you're expending significant emotional labor and plan for recovery time. Just as physical work requires rest, emotional work requires space to process feelings and recharge.
