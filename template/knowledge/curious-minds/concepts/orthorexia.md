# Orthorexia

## What It Is

Orthorexia is an obsession with eating foods that one considers to be healthy, taken to an extreme that actually damages physical health, mental well-being, and social functioning. Unlike anorexia or bulimia, which focus on quantity or weight, orthorexia fixates on food quality and purity. People with orthorexia may severely restrict their diet, avoiding entire food groups they deem "unhealthy," leading to nutritional deficiencies and social isolation.

## Origin

The term was coined by physician Steven Bratman in 1997, combining "ortho" (correct) and "orexia" (appetite). Bratman observed patients who had become so fixated on healthy eating that it had become unhealthy. While not officially recognized as an eating disorder in diagnostic manuals, orthorexia represents a growing concern in our health-conscious culture.

The condition often develops from genuinely wanting to improve health but becomes pathological when the pursuit of dietary perfection takes over one's life.

## Applications

- **Personal Health:** Notice when healthy eating habits become rigid rules that create anxiety, social isolation, or nutritional imbalance. Health should enhance your life, not restrict it.
- **Social Media Consumption:** Be aware of how wellness influencers and health content might be promoting orthorexic thinking through extreme dietary restrictions or moral language around food choices.
- **Parenting:** Model balanced attitudes toward food and health for children. Avoid labeling foods as "good" or "bad" in moral terms, and emphasize how different foods serve different purposes.
- **Professional Health Advice:** If you work in nutrition, fitness, or wellness, be mindful of how your messaging might contribute to orthorexic thinking. Promote flexible, sustainable approaches to health.
