## Section Guide

### Subject Line
- Max 8 words
- Specific, not vague ("AI startup cuts cart abandonment 40%" not "Exciting company news")
- Include the hook, not the company name
- No ALL CAPS, no exclamation marks

### Personalized Hook (1-2 sentences)
- Reference journalist's recent article by name
- Connect their beat to your story
- Show you actually read their work
- "Your recent piece on [topic] resonated because..."
- NEVER: "I'm a big fan of your work" (generic)

### Pitch Body (2-3 sentences)
- The story, not the company
- Lead with the trend/insight, then position the company
- Include one compelling data point
- Why NOW? Timeliness hook

### Call to Action (1 sentence)
- Specific and easy: "Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick call?"
- Or: "Happy to send over the full press release and exec availability"
- Never: "Let me know if you're interested" (too passive)

## Pitch Types

### Product Launch
- Lead with the problem being solved
- Include user/customer impact data
- Offer exclusive or embargo if Tier 1

### Funding Announcement
