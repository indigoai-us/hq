## Section Guide

### Headline
- Take a position. Op-eds argue, they don't report
- Good: "Why Most AI Startups Are Solving the Wrong Problem"
- Bad: "Thoughts on AI in 2026"

### Hook (1 paragraph)
- Start with a specific moment, anecdote, or surprising fact
- NOT "In today's fast-paced world..."
- Make the reader feel something in the first sentence

### Context (1 paragraph)
- Why this matters now
- Connect to a current trend, event, or debate
- Establish why the reader should care

### Argument (2 paragraphs)
- Make your case with evidence
- Use specific examples, data, or personal experience
- Each paragraph = one sub-argument

### Counterargument (1 paragraph)
- Acknowledge the strongest opposing view
- Explain why your position still holds
- Shows intellectual honesty

### Conclusion (1 paragraph)
- End with a clear takeaway or call to action
- What should the reader do or think differently?
- Circle back to the opening hook if possible
