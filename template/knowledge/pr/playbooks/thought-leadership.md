# Thought Leadership Playbook

## Pipeline: Topics → Publications → Drafts → Placements

### Step 1: Topic Identification
- Scan current industry news and trends (WebSearch)
- Review founder's recent social posts, talks, interviews
- Identify contrarian or unique angles the founder can own
- Match topics to the founder's actual expertise and experience

### Step 2: Publication Targeting
| Category | Examples | Approach |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Tier 1 national | Forbes, TechCrunch, Wired, HBR | Pitch editor with finished draft |
| Tier 2 industry | SaaS publications, fintech press | Pitch with outline, offer to write |
| Tier 3 niche | Industry newsletters, blogs | Guest post with direct submission |
| Owned | LinkedIn, personal blog, X threads | Publish directly, repurpose later |

### Step 3: Draft Op-Ed
- Load `templates/op-ed.md` for structure
- Load `companies/personal/knowledge/voice-style.md` for {your-name}'s voice
- Match publication tone (formal for Forbes, casual for blog)
- Include personal anecdotes or proprietary data

### Step 4: Pitch Editor
- Research the specific editor who handles guest contributions
- Personalize pitch to their section focus
- Include 2-3 sentence summary + full draft attached
- Follow up at day 5 and day 10
