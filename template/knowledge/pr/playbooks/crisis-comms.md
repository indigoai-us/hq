# Crisis Communications Playbook

## Response Protocol

### Detection
1. Alert from: social media, customer support, media inquiry, internal report
2. Assess severity (Tier 1-3, see `templates/crisis-statement.md`)
3. Notify company leadership immediately

### First 2 Hours (Tier 3 only)
1. Gather facts — what happened, who's affected, what do we know
2. Draft initial statement using `templates/crisis-statement.md`
3. Get legal and leadership approval
4. Release statement via: company blog, social media, press@ email
5. Set up dedicated response channel

### Ongoing Management
- Daily updates until resolved (Tier 3)
- Every 48 hours (Tier 2)
- Monitor coverage and sentiment via pr-monitor
- Track all media inquiries and responses
- Single spokesperson — no multiple voices

### Post-Crisis
- Internal debrief within 1 week
- Coverage report with sentiment analysis
- Lessons learned document
- Update crisis playbook with new learnings

## Key Principles
1. **Speed over perfection** — A brief honest statement now beats a polished one tomorrow
2. **Empathy first** — Lead with impact on people, not on company
3. **One voice** — Single spokesperson, consistent messaging across all channels
4. **No speculation** — Only state confirmed facts
5. **Forward-looking** — Every statement includes what we're doing next
6. **Never say "no comment"** — Say "We're investigating and will share more when we can"
