## Rule

State the rule clearly in imperative form. One rule per policy is ideal. If multiple rules are needed, use a numbered list.

1. Always do X before starting work
2. Never do Y without confirmation
3. After completing work, do Z

## Rationale

Explain why this policy exists. What problem does it prevent? What outcome does it ensure? This helps agents understand the intent, not just the letter of the rule.

## Examples

**Correct:**
- Agent checks the docs site after completing a feature and updates the relevant page

**Incorrect:**
- Agent completes a feature without updating documentation
