# Changelog

## v8.1.0 (2026-03-12)

Ralph loop reliability — in-session mode default, 3-layer passes detection, swarm retry tracking, per-story branch isolation, project reanchor, and 10+ reliability fixes.

### Added

- **`/run-project` — In-session mode default** — Stories run as Task() sub-agents within the current Claude session (faster, no process overhead). Headless bash mode via `--bash` flag.
- **`/run-project` — `--codex-autofix` flag** — Auto-fix P1/P2 codex review findings via targeted `claude -p` agent with 300s timeout.
- **`/run-project` — Context safety limits** — Auto-handoff after 6 stories or 70% context ceiling.
- **`/run-project` — Project Reanchor** — Every 3 completed stories, evaluates remaining stories for spec drift. Writes reanchor report.
- **`run-project.sh` — 3-layer passes detection** — Layer 1 (JSON parse) → Layer 2 (full-file scan for task_id+status pairs) → Layer 3 (git heuristic: commits after checkout + declared files touched). Replaces simple grep fallback.
- **`run-project.sh` — Swarm retry tracking** — `_swarm_retry_get()`/`_swarm_retry_inc()` with max 2 retries per story. Exhausted stories filtered from new batch selection.
- **`run-project.sh` — Per-story branch isolation** — `project-branch--story-slug` naming avoids "already checked out" conflicts in swarm mode.
- **`run-project.sh` — Full commit-range cherry-pick** — Uses `merge-base` to capture all worktree commits, not just HEAD.
- **`run-project.sh` — Stale PID cleanup** — Dead PIDs from crashed processes cleaned from `current_tasks` on startup.
- **`run-project.sh` — macOS timeout fallback** — `gtimeout` → `perl -e alarm` chain for bash 3.2 compatibility.
- **`run-project.sh` — Mandatory termination protocol** — Stricter sub-agent JSON output enforcement ("LAST output must be JSON only").

### Changed

- **`/prd` — 7-batch interview** — Expanded from 4 to 7 question batches (Users/Current State, Data/Architecture, Integrations, Quality/Shipping as separate batches). Dynamic question enrichment from company policies and repo scan.
- **CLAUDE.md — Token optimization** — `MAX_THINKING_TOKENS` bumped to 31999. Added `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_ADAPTIVE_THINKING` env var.
- **CLAUDE.md — Linear rules 11 & 12** — Default assignee by team + no-orphan-issues enforcement.
- **13 commands PII-scrubbed** — audit, cleanup, garden, model-route, reanchor, recover-session, remember, run, search, search-reindex, startwork, update-hq refreshed.

### Fixed

- `run-project.sh` — `files_changed` JSON validation in `update_state_completed()`
- `run-project.sh` — Empty PID → null (was crash on empty string)
- `run-project.sh` — `date -u` flag for BSD date UTC correctness
- `run-project.sh` — Per-story branch cleanup after worktree merge (was leaking branches)
- `run-project.sh` — `process_swarm_completion()` receives `start_epoch` for Layer 3 git heuristic

---

## v8.0.1 (2026-03-10)

### Fixed

- **`run-project.sh` — bash 3.2 crash** — 8 `local` declarations outside functions caused `set -e` to exit the script on macOS (bash 3.2). Affected swarm dispatch, sequential retry-skip, and project completion code paths. Replaced with plain variable assignments.
- **`run-project.sh` — worktree self-removal** — When `branchName` matches the repo's current checkout (e.g., both are `main`), `ensure_worktree()` now detects this and skips worktree setup instead of "reusing" the main repo as a worktree. Prevents `cleanup_worktree()` from attempting to `git worktree remove` the main working directory on exit.

## v8.0.0 (2026-03-10)

Policy-first system — all major commands now scan and enforce policies. `/learn` rewrite creates policy files as primary output. 1 new command (`/strategize`), smarter regression gates.

### Added

- **Standard Policy Loading Protocol** (CLAUDE.md) — 5-step protocol for all commands to load company → repo → global policies. Documents which commands implement it.
- **`/startwork` — Policy scan** (Step 2.5) — Sessions now load applicable policies on startup. Displays policy counts + hard-enforcement rule titles in orientation block.
- **`/run-project` — Pre-Loop policy loading** — Orchestrator loads company + repo + global policies before entering the Ralph loop. Hard-enforcement policies block the loop if violated.
- **`/prd` — Repo policy loading** — PRD creation now checks `{repoPath}/.claude/policies/` for repo-scoped constraints (commit hooks, deploy procedures, code location rules).
- **`/run` — Policy loading** (Step 1b) — Worker execution loads company policies from worker path context and repo policies if applicable.
- **`/learn` — Scan existing policies** (Step 4.5) — Before creating new rules, scans existing policy files for updates. Prevents duplicate policies.
- **`/learn` — Policy file output** — Primary output is now structured policy files (YAML frontmatter + Rule + Rationale) in scope-appropriate directories. Worker.yaml injection retained as fallback for worker-specific learnings only.
- **`run-project.sh` — Regression baseline** — Captures pre-existing error counts on first gate run. Only flags errors above baseline as regressions, preventing false positives in repos with pre-existing issues.
- **`run-project.sh` — Headless doc sweep** — `run_doc_sweep()` runs `claude -p` to update 4 documentation layers (internal docs, external docs, repo knowledge, company knowledge) after project completion. Replaces interactive doc-sweep-flag.json.
- **`run-project.sh` — Swarm mode** (`--swarm [N]`) — Parallel story execution via git worktrees. Pre-acquires file locks, dispatches eligible stories as background `claude -p` processes, monitors PIDs with periodic check-ins, cherry-picks commits sequentially. Stories without `files[]` are never swarmed.
- **`run-project.sh` — Signal trapping** — `cleanup_on_signal()` catches SIGINT/SIGTERM, kills swarm children, releases locks/checkouts, sets state to "paused".
- **`run-project.sh` — Worktree isolation** — Each project gets its own git worktree for branch isolation. `check_repo_conflict()` detects concurrent orchestrators on the same repo. `ensure_worktree()` / `cleanup_worktree()` manage lifecycle.
- **`settings/orchestrator.yaml` — Swarm config** — New `swarm:` section with `max_concurrency`, `checkin_interval_seconds`, `require_files_declared`.
- **New command** — `/strategize` for strategic prioritization with optional deep review.

### Changed

- **`/learn`** — Major rewrite: policy files are now primary output (was worker.yaml/CLAUDE.md injection). Step 3 scope resolution targets policy directories. Step 5 creates structured policy files per `policies-spec.md`. CLAUDE.md `## Learned Rules` reserved for global promotion of critical rules only.
- **`/startwork`** — Now policy-aware: loads company, repo, and global policies during session startup.
- **`/run-project`** — Now policy-aware: loads policies before first task, passes to sub-agents.
- **`/prd`** — Now loads repo policies in addition to company policies during PRD creation.
- **`/run`** — Now policy-aware: determines company from worker path and loads applicable policies.
- **`/audit`**, **`/handoff`**, **`/harness-audit`**, **`/model-route`** — Various improvements.
- **`run-project.sh`** — Regression gates upgraded with baseline comparison. Headless doc sweep. Swarm mode (+716 lines). Signal trapping. Worktree isolation. Budget caps removed.
- **`/execute-task`** — Self-owned lock skip (orchestrator pre-acquires for swarm). Orchestrator writes `passes` (single-writer pattern).
- **CLAUDE.md** — Added Standard Policy Loading Protocol to Policies section. Updated command count to 44+.

---

Company-scoped projects, file lock acquisition, policy loading, and new commands.

### Added

- **/imessage** — Send iMessage to saved contacts via Messages.app.
- **/execute-task — File lock acquisition** (step 5.5) — Acquires file locks on start, releases on completion/failure. Conflict modes: `hard_block`, `soft_block`, `read_only_fallback`.
- **/execute-task — Policy loading** (step 5.6) — Loads applicable policies from company, repo, and global directories before worker execution.
- **/execute-task — Dynamic file lock expansion** (step 6d.5) — Workers can touch more files than predicted; locks expand dynamically.

- **CLAUDE.md — Knowledge Repos** — Clarified embedded vs symlinked repos.

---

## v6.3.0 (2026-02-21)

Policies, file locking, Glob safety hook, and safe settings.json migration.

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md — Policies** — Company-scoped standing rules (`companies/{co}/policies/`) with hard/soft enforcement. Proactive directives that override default behavior. Template at `companies/_template/policies/example-policy.md`.
- **CLAUDE.md — File Locking** — Story-scoped file flags prevent concurrent edit conflicts in multi-agent projects. Config via `settings/orchestrator.yaml`, locks in `.file-locks.json`.
- **Glob safety hook** — PreToolUse hook (`block-hq-glob.sh`) blocks Glob from HQ root, preventing 20s+ timeouts from symlinked repos. Suggests scoped paths instead.
- **companies/_template/policies/** — Policy template for `/newcompany` scaffolding. YAML frontmatter (id, title, scope, trigger, enforcement) + markdown body.
- **/update-hq — settings.json merge** — New 5b-SETTINGS section with JSON-aware hook merging. Preserves user permissions and custom hooks, adds new hook entries from upstream without overwriting.

- **`.claude/settings.json`** — Added PreToolUse hook entry for Glob safety.
- **/update-hq** — Added settings.json special handling (5b-SETTINGS section), template directory handling, updated step numbering.

---

## v6.2.0 (2026-02-20)

New CLAUDE.md behavioral sections and expanded learned rules.

### Added

- **CLAUDE.md — Session Handoffs** — Explicit handoff workflow: commit first, write handoff.json, update INDEX, create thread. Never plan mode during handoff.
- **CLAUDE.md — Corrections & Accuracy** — Apply user corrections exactly as stated. No re-interpretation or paraphrasing.
- **CLAUDE.md — Sub-Agent Rules** — Sub-agents must commit own work before completing. Orchestrator verifies uncommitted changes.
- **CLAUDE.md — Git Workflow Rules** — Branch verification, merge-over-rebase for diverged branches, hook bypass during merge/rebase, no accidental main commits.
- **CLAUDE.md — Vercel Deployments** — Org/team verification, framework detection checks, SSO fallback to local testing.

### Changed

- **CLAUDE.md — Learned Rules** — 6 new rules: Vercel custom domain deploy safety, Task() sub-agents lack MCP, Shopify 2026 auth, Vercel preview SSO, Vercel domain team move, Vercel framework detection. Max cap raised 10 → 25.

---

## v6.1.0 (2026-02-20)

Codex CLI integration — fixes codex workers not actually calling OpenAI Codex in the pipeline.

### Changed

- **`/execute-task`** — Added inline Codex review step (6c.5) that runs `codex review --uncommitted` directly via Bash instead of spawning a sub-agent. Deterministic — cannot be skipped. Added pre-flight `which codex` check (step 2.5) with graceful degradation. Codex debugger auto-recovery now uses CLI when available.
- **codex-reviewer** — All 3 skills (review-code, improve-code, apply-best-practices) rewritten from MCP tool calls to Codex CLI (`codex review`, `codex exec --full-auto`). Worker YAML updated: MCP section replaced with CLI config.
- **codex-coder** — All 3 skills (generate-code, implement-feature, scaffold-component) rewritten from MCP to `codex exec --full-auto` via Bash.
- **codex-debugger** — All 3 skills (debug-issue, root-cause-analysis, fix-bug) rewritten from MCP to Codex CLI. Root-cause-analysis uses `codex exec --sandbox read-only` for analysis-only mode.
- **codex-engine** — Description updated. MCP server kept for standalone use but no longer required for pipeline execution.

### Fixed

- **Codex workers actually call Codex now** — Previously, Task() sub-agents didn't inherit MCP server connections, so codex-reviewer/coder/debugger could never access their MCP tools. They either skipped the phase or ran as Claude-only reviews. CLI-based approach works because Bash is always available to sub-agents.

## v6.0.0 (2026-02-19)

Major release: 5 worker teams (39 workers), gardener audit system, new commands.

- **`/setup`** — Phase 0 expanded (2 checks → 4), Phase 2 now includes knowledge repo creation + symlinks + `.gitignore` updates. Time estimate 2min → 5min.

---

## v5.1.0 (2026-02-08)

### Added
- **Context Diet** — New section in `.claude/CLAUDE.md` with lazy-loading rules to minimize context burn on session start. Sessions no longer pre-load INDEX.md or agents.md unless the task requires it.

### Changed
- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — Added Context Diet section, updated Key Files to discourage eager loading
- **`/checkpoint`** — Recent threads now written to `workspace/threads/recent.md` (not embedded in INDEX.md). INDEX.md gets timestamp-only updates.
- **`/handoff`** — Same change: threads to `recent.md`, slim INDEX.md updates
- **`/reanchor`** — Added "When to Use" guidance: only run when explicitly called or disoriented, never auto-trigger
- Knowledge files refreshed: `Ralph/11-team-training-guide.md`, `hq-core/index-md-spec.md`, `hq-core/thread-schema.md`, `workers/README.md`, `workers/skill-schema.md`, `workers/state-machine.md`, `workers/templates/base-worker.yaml`, `projects/README.md`

---

## v5.0.0 (2026-02-07)

### Added
- **`/personal-interview`** — Deep conversational interview to build your profile and social voice. Populates `profile.md`, `voice-style.md`, and `agents.md` from ~18 thoughtful questions.
- **`workers/sample-worker/`** — Example worker with `worker.yaml` and `skills/example.md`. Copy and customize to build your own.

### Changed
- **`/setup`** — Simplified from 5 phases to 3. Now asks just name, work, and goals. Recommends `/personal-interview` for deeper profile building.
- **`.claude/CLAUDE.md`** — Updated structure (18 commands, sample-worker), added `/personal-interview` to commands table. Removed bundled worker listings.
- **`/execute-task`** — Added codebase exploration guidance (qmd collection search for workers), Linear sync integration for completed tasks
- **`/handoff`** — Added auto-commit of HQ changes before handoff (not just knowledge repos)
- **`/prd`** — Added target repo scanning via qmd collections during PRD creation
- **`/run-project`** — Added Linear sync integration (sets tasks to "In Progress" on execution start)
- **`/search`** — Added company auto-detection from context (cwd, active worker, recent files), enhanced collection scoping
- **`/search-reindex`** — Multi-collection architecture docs, instructions for adding new repo collections
- **`/cleanup`**, **`/reanchor`** — Genericized company INDEX paths
- `workers/registry.yaml` — Version 5.0, sample-worker only

- `knowledge/projects/README.md` — Updated project examples

### Removed
- **All bundled workers** — `workers/dev-team/` (12 workers), `workers/content-*/` (5 workers), `workers/security-scanner/` removed. Build your own with `/newworker` using `sample-worker/` as reference.
- **`starter-projects/`** — Removed. Use `/prd` to create projects.

### Breaking
- Workers directory restructured: all pre-built workers removed. If you use dev-team or content workers, keep your existing copies.
- `/setup` no longer offers starter project selection. Use `/prd` + `/newworker` instead.

---

## v4.0.0 (2026-01-31)

### Added
- **`/learn`** — Automated learning pipeline: captures learnings from task execution/failure and injects rules directly into the files they govern (worker.yaml, command .md, knowledge files, or CLAUDE.md). Deduplicates via qmd, supports global promotion, event logging.
- **INDEX.md System** — Hierarchical INDEX.md files provide navigable maps of HQ. Auto-updated by `/checkpoint`, `/handoff`, `/reanchor`, `/prd`, `/run-project`, `/newworker`. Spec at `knowledge/hq-core/index-md-spec.md`
- **Knowledge Repos** — Knowledge folders can now be independent git repos, symlinked into HQ for versioning and sharing

## 2026-01-21

### PRD-First Planning
Added rules to redirect Claude's built-in planning to HQ's PRD system.

**Problem:** Claude Code triggers session-local plan mode for "complex" tasks. These plans live in `.claude/plans/`, are ephemeral, and compete with HQ's persistent PRD workflow.

**Solution:** Skills now redirect to `/newproject` when complex planning is needed. Plans belong in `prd.json` files that persist across sessions and integrate with `/ralph-loop`.

**Changes:**
- All skills: Redirect `EnterPlanMode` → suggest `/newproject` instead
- All skills: Redirect `TodoWrite` → PRD features track tasks

**Result:** Planning happens in the right place (PRD), not session-local files.
